# Module 13 challenge: E-commerce Back End

## Description

This Module 13 Challenge repository was created to complete the Module 13 Challenge of the bootcamp.

This project aims to build the back end infrastructure of the E-commerce application, which the user can view, add, edit or delete 
the items in their store, including categories (of item), product tags, and the products themselves. Since the application does not have
an interface, the software "Insomnia" has to be used to perform the actions above, a link to the demonstration video has been attached
in the README as a guide to use this project. 
## Installation

Please make sure to run the command "npm install" to install all required node modules before running the program. 
Please also make sure to run "source schema.sql" after logged in to MySQL for initializing the database, and "npm run seed" for inserting
seed data.

## Usage

Please run the command "npm start" in terminal to start the command-line application.
